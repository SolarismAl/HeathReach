# Errors Fixed in auth-service.ts

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. ✅ Unused Import
**Problem:** `apiService` was imported but never used
```typescript
// REMOVED:
import apiService from './api';
```

### 2. ✅ Duplicate Import in signInWithEmail
**Problem:** `getFirebaseAuth` was imported at the top AND inside the method
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const { getFirebaseAuth } = await import('./firebase');  // Duplicate!

// AFTER:
// Removed - already imported at top of file
```

### 3. ✅ Duplicate Import in getCurrentUser
**Problem:** `getFirebaseAuth` was imported again inside this method
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const { getFirebaseAuth } = await import('./firebase');  // Duplicate!

// AFTER:
// Removed - already imported at top of file
```

## File is Now Clean

All TypeScript/ESLint errors should be resolved. The file now:
- ✅ Has no unused imports
- ✅ Has no duplicate imports
- ✅ Uses Firebase Authentication correctly
- ✅ Stores Firebase ID tokens (not custom tokens)
- ✅ Works in both development and production

## Next Steps

1. **Save the file** (should already be saved)
2. **Rebuild the app:**
   ```bash
   cd HealthReach
   eas build --profile preview --platform android
   ```
3. **Test on your phone:**
   - Login should now work correctly
   - Token length should be 1000+ chars (Firebase ID token)
   - Dashboard should load without "Authorization token is required" errors

## What to Expect

After rebuilding and testing, you should see in the logs:
```
✅ Firebase sign-in successful
✅ Got Firebase ID token (length): 1057  ← Should be 1000+, not 914!
✅ Firebase ID token and user data stored
Token storage verification: { firebase_id_token: 'Stored', userToken: 'Stored', tokenLength: 1057 }
```

The key difference:
- ❌ Old: 914 chars = Custom JWT token (rejected by backend)
- ✅ New: 1000+ chars = Firebase ID token (accepted by backend)
