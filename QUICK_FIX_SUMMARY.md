# Quick Fix Summary: Auth Component Not Registered

## What Was Wrong
Firebase Auth wasn't fully initialized before login attempts in production builds.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Longer Delays** (firebase.ts)
- Environment setup: 500ms
- Firebase ready: 3000ms  
- Retry delays: 2s, 4s, 6s, 8s, 10s

### 2. **Pre-Import Auth Methods** (firebase.ts line 119)
```typescript
const { getAuth, signInWithEmailAndPassword, signInWithCustomToken, signOut } = await import('firebase/auth');
```

### 3. **Blocking Initialization** (AuthContext.tsx)
- Added `firebaseReady` state
- Login blocked until Firebase ready
- Throws error if initialization fails

### 4. **Login Guard** (AuthContext.tsx line 147)
```typescript
if (!firebaseReady) {
  throw new Error('Firebase is still initializing...');
}
```

### 5. **UI Feedback** (login screen)
- Button shows "Initializing..." during setup
- Button disabled until ready
- Clear error messages

## Rebuild Command
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production --clear-cache
```

## Expected Behavior
1. App starts → "Initializing..." (3-5 seconds)
2. Button changes to "Sign In"
3. Login works without errors
4. User redirected to dashboard

## Key Logs to Look For
```
✅ Window mock created
✅ All Firebase modules imported (including auth methods)
✅ Firebase Auth pre-initialized successfully
✅ Firebase is now ready for login attempts
✅ Firebase sign-in successful
```

## If Still Failing
Increase delays in `services/firebase.ts`:
- Line 179: `3000` → `5000`
- Line 234: `2000` → `3000`

**Files Changed**: firebase.ts, AuthContext.tsx, login screen
**Status**: Ready for production build
