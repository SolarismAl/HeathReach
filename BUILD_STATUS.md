## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)

These issues don't prevent the build from succeeding, but should be addressed:

### 1. Icon Dimensions (Build Still Works)
The app icons are not square, but the build succeeded anyway. For a polished app, fix these:

**Current Issues:**
- `icon.png`: 558x447 ‚Üí Should be 1024x1024
- `android-icon-foreground.png`: 189x183 ‚Üí Should be 512x512
- `android-icon-background.png`: 189x183 ‚Üí Should be 512x512
- `android-icon-monochrome.png`: 189x183 ‚Üí Should be 512x512

**Why It Still Built:**
EAS Build is lenient with icon dimensions during development builds. The icons will display, just potentially with some distortion.

**How to Fix (Optional for now):**
```bash
# Option 1: Use an online tool to resize
# - Visit: https://www.resizeimage.net/
# - Upload each icon and resize to required dimensions

# Option 2: Use image editing software
# - Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, Canva, etc.
# - Resize to exact square dimensions
# - Save as PNG with transparency
```

### 2. Native Project Folders Present
Your project has both `android/` and `ios/` folders AND app.json configuration. This means:
- EAS Build uses the native folders (not app.json settings)
- Some app.json properties are ignored during build
- This is fine if you're managing native code directly

**Affected Properties (Ignored in Build):**
- orientation
- icon
- scheme
- userInterfaceStyle
- ios/android configs
- plugins
- androidStatusBar

**Options:**
1. **Keep as is** - If you need custom native code
2. **Remove native folders** - If you want Prebuild to manage everything
   ```bash
   rm -rf android/ ios/
   npx expo prebuild
   ```

### 3. Duplicate Dependencies (Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Added React resolution to package.json
- ‚úÖ Added .expo/ to .gitignore
- Run `npm install` to apply the fixes

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Test Your Build)
1. **Install the APK** on your Android device using the QR code
2. **Test all features** to ensure everything works
3. **Report any issues** you encounter

### Before Production Release
1. **Fix icon dimensions** for professional appearance
2. **Run dependency cleanup:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx expo-doctor
   ```
3. **Test thoroughly** on multiple devices
4. **Build production version:**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile production
   ```
