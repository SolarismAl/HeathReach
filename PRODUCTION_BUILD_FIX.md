# Production Build Fix: "Component Auth is Not Registered Yet"

## Problem
Your local web version works perfectly, but the production mobile build shows the error:
**"component auth is not registered yet"**

This happens because Firebase Auth initialization is **async** and production builds have stricter timing than development.

## Root Cause
1. Firebase Auth component wasn't fully registered before the app tried to use it
2. Production builds don't wait for async initialization like development does
3. Mock window/document objects for React Native needed more comprehensive setup

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Firebase Initialization (`services/firebase.ts`)
- ✅ Added comprehensive window/document mocks for production
- ✅ Added `crypto.getRandomValues` mock for Firebase Auth
- ✅ Increased initialization delays in production (1500ms vs 500ms)
- ✅ Enhanced retry logic: 5 attempts in production vs 3 in development
- ✅ Exponential backoff with longer delays in production
- ✅ Better error logging with stack traces
- ✅ Re-import Firebase modules on retry in production

### 2. Pre-initialization in AuthContext (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- ✅ Added Firebase pre-initialization before checking stored tokens
- ✅ Increased timeout to 10 seconds in production
- ✅ Ensures Firebase Auth is registered before any auth operations

### 3. Production-Ready Error Handling
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging production issues
- ✅ Clear error messages with solutions
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks if initialization fails

## How to Test

### 1. Rebuild Your Production App
```bash
# For Android
eas build --platform android --profile production --clear-cache

# For iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

### 2. Install Fresh Build
- Uninstall the old app completely
- Install the new build
- Clear app cache if needed

### 3. Check Logs
When you open the app, you should see these logs in order:
```
=== FIREBASE INIT START ===
Platform detected: android (or ios)
Environment: Production
Creating window mock for Firebase...
✅ Window mock created
Creating document mock for Firebase...
✅ Document mock created
Waiting for environment setup...
Firebase modules loaded successfully
Waiting 1500ms for Firebase app to be ready...
Auth initialization attempt 1/5
✅ Firebase Auth getAuth() called successfully
✅ Auth instance verified - currentUser property exists
AuthContext: Pre-initializing Firebase...
AuthContext: ✅ Firebase Auth pre-initialized successfully
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Option 1: Check Firebase Configuration
Verify your `app.json` has correct Firebase config:
```json
"extra": {
  "firebaseApiKey": "AIzaSyCLviE9L1ihRAafW14XH-li4M67CjyFbBc",
  "firebaseAuthDomain": "healthreach-9167b.firebaseapp.com",
  "firebaseProjectId": "healthreach-9167b",
  "firebaseStorageBucket": "healthreach-9167b.firebasestorage.app",
  "firebaseMessagingSenderId": "1035041170898",
  "firebaseAppId": "1:1035041170898:web:5dd9a3435662835d15940b"
}
```

### Option 2: Increase Delays Further
If the error persists, increase delays in `services/firebase.ts`:
- Line 176: Change `1500` to `2500` or `3000`
- Line 231: Change `authInitAttempts * 1000` to `authInitAttempts * 1500`

### Option 3: Use Development Build for Testing
```bash
# Build development version to see detailed logs
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Production Build Should:
1. Initialize Firebase Auth successfully
2. Show login screen without errors
3. Allow users to login with email/password
4. Store tokens correctly
5. Navigate to appropriate dashboard based on role

### ✅ Console Logs Should Show:
- No "component auth is not registered yet" errors
- Successful Firebase initialization
- Successful auth operations
- Token storage confirmations

## Technical Details

### Why This Happens
Firebase Web SDK (which we use for React Native compatibility) expects certain browser APIs:
- `window.location`
- `document.createElement`
- `crypto.getRandomValues`
- `localStorage` / `sessionStorage`

In production builds, these mocks must be:
1. **Comprehensive** - Include all required properties
2. **Synchronous** - Available immediately
3. **Persistent** - Stay available throughout app lifecycle

### Why It Works in Development
- Metro bundler is more forgiving
- Hot reload keeps Firebase initialized
- Longer timeouts and better error recovery
- More detailed logging helps catch issues early

### Why It Fails in Production
- Stricter timing requirements
- No hot reload to maintain state
- Minification can affect timing
- Less detailed error messages

## Monitoring

After deploying, monitor these metrics:
1. **Firebase initialization time** - Should be < 3 seconds
2. **Auth success rate** - Should be > 99%
3. **Error logs** - Should show no "component not registered" errors
4. **User feedback** - Users should report successful logins

## Rollback Plan

If the fix doesn't work, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting changes to `services/firebase.ts`
2. Reverting changes to `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
3. Rebuilding with previous version

## Support

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check device logs with `adb logcat` (Android) or Xcode Console (iOS)
2. Enable remote debugging
3. Test on different devices
4. Check Firebase Console for auth errors
