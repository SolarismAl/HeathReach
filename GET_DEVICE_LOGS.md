# Get Device Logs for Firebase Initialization Issue

## The Problem
Your production build shows: **"Firebase is still initializing. Please wait a moment and try again"**

This means `firebaseReady` is never being set to `true`, which indicates Firebase initialization is failing.

## Get the Logs

### For Android (using ADB)

1. **Connect your device** via USB or WiFi
2. **Enable USB Debugging** on your device
3. **Run this command** to see all logs:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "(Firebase|AuthContext|env\.ts|FIREBASE_INIT)"
```

Or save to a file:
```bash
adb logcat > device_logs.txt
```

Then search the file for:
- `Firebase`
- `AuthContext`
- `FIREBASE_INIT`
- `Error`

### What to Look For

#### ✅ **Success Logs** (what you should see):
```
env.ts: Configuration loaded
env.ts: FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: healthreach-9167b
=== FIREBASE INIT START ===
Platform detected: android
Environment: Production
Creating window mock for Firebase...
✅ Window mock created
✅ Document mock created
Importing Firebase modules...
✅ All Firebase modules imported (including auth methods)
Firebase app initialized successfully
Waiting 3000ms for Firebase app to be ready...
✅ Firebase Auth getAuth() called successfully
✅ Auth instance verified - currentUser property exists
=== FIREBASE INIT COMPLETE (5234ms) ===
AuthContext: ✅ Firebase Auth pre-initialized successfully
AuthContext: ✅ Firebase is now ready for login attempts
```

#### ❌ **Failure Logs** (what might be happening):
```
=== FIREBASE INIT FAILED (1234ms) ===
Error message: [SOME ERROR]
FAILURE POINT: Firebase Auth initialization failed
AuthContext: ❌ Firebase init attempt 1/3 failed
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Environment Variables Not Loading
**Logs show**: `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: undefined`

**Solution**: Check that your `eas.json` has the env variables in the build profile:
```json
"preview": {
  "env": {
    "EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY": "AIzaSyCLviE9L1ihRAafW14XH-li4M67CjyFbBc",
    "EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID": "healthreach-9167b",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Issue 2: Timeout Before Initialization Complete
**Logs show**: `AuthContext: Initialization timeout after 20000ms`

**Solution**: Device is too slow. Increase timeout in `AuthContext.tsx` line 49:
```typescript
const timeoutDuration = __DEV__ ? 5000 : 30000; // 30 seconds
```

### Issue 3: Auth Component Not Registered
**Logs show**: `component auth is not registered yet`

**Solution**: Increase delay in `firebase.ts` line 179:
```typescript
const delay = __DEV__ ? 500 : 5000; // 5 seconds
```

### Issue 4: Module Import Failure
**Logs show**: `Error importing Firebase modules`

**Solution**: Check that Firebase packages are installed:
```bash
npm list firebase
```

Should show:
- firebase@10.x.x or higher

## Quick Test Commands

### Check if device is connected:
```bash
adb devices
```

### Clear app data and restart:
```bash
adb shell pm clear com.alfonso_solar2.healthreach
adb shell am start -n com.alfonso_solar2.healthreach/.MainActivity
```

### Get just errors:
```bash
adb logcat | grep -i error
```

### Get Firebase-specific logs:
```bash
adb logcat | grep -i firebase
```

## Share the Logs

After running the commands, share:
1. The first 100 lines after app starts
2. Any lines containing "FIREBASE_INIT"
3. Any lines containing "AuthContext"
4. Any lines containing "Error" or "Failed"

This will help identify exactly where the initialization is failing.

## Temporary Workaround

If you need the app to work immediately while debugging:

1. Comment out the `firebaseReady` check in `AuthContext.tsx` line 147-151
2. Rebuild
3. This will allow login attempts even if Firebase isn't ready (risky but might work)

```typescript
// Temporarily disable check
// if (!firebaseReady) {
//   throw new Error('Firebase is still initializing...');
// }
```

**Note**: This is NOT recommended for production, only for testing!
